<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h3>The problem</h3>
You have a private repo on Github and you want to deploy it to VPS upon git post to main branch using a workflow file

The following technologies are used:

<ul>
 <li>SSH</li>
 <li>public \ private key authentication (VPS)</li>
 <li>Github Actions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>High level schema</h3>
There are four components
<ul>
<li>your local machine - issue from here e.g. git push to main branch</li>
<li>Github - your private repo to be deployed on VPS is here</li>
<li>Github Actions Runner - this run the workflow file</li>
<li>VPS - here the private repo is deployed</li>

</ul>

<h3>Design questions</h3>
<ul>
 <li>should i use ssh agent </li>
 </ul>

<h3>Design question : the repo is privte so how the VPS can clone it</h3>
Using github actions the best solution is to use GITHUB_TOKEN . 

When Does This Work Best?
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>GitHub Actions Manages the Deployment:</strong>
    The entire deployment process (including fetching or updating the repository) is handled in the GitHub Actions workflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minimal VPS Configuration:</strong>
    Ideal when the VPS doesnâ€™t need long-term credentials to manage the repository independently.
  </li>
  <li>
    This solution is especially suited for modern CI/CD pipelines where security and simplicity are priorities.
  </li>
</ul>


 <h3>Design question : where to store VPS SSH private key so the runner can access it </h3>
The best solution to store screts in github is to use Github secrets which is part of the repo. And this is what i will use
